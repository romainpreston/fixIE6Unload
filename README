known issues : 
¥ slows down the javascript because it has to test if the unload function is still there : it disappears for example when someone adds a window event using mootools (ex : window.addEvent("resize", somefunction) )

todo : 
¥ use internet explorer 6 methods to clean up the page.

credits : 
¥ the whole script comes from : 
http://ajaxian.com/archives/are-you-sure-your-unload-handler-is-firing-in-ie
using that script, we're sure that the unload event is fired and we can properly clean the memory
